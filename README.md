# OneCampus Python Project

This is my Python completion project which allowed me move to the next phase of learning (Data Wrangling). The project tested my knowledge in all aspect of python fundamentals.

### Project Scenario 

Jerome is a teacher at the Grand Rapids High School. Due to the lack of teachers willing to accept in-person teaching positions during the Covid era, Jerome has had to teach Math, Chemistry, Biology and Physics for the 8th grade students.
The school term is made up of 96 class sessions and attendance is taken each day. Students earn 1 point for each class attendance. Jerome computes percentage class attendance and awards proportional score with a maximum possible score of 12 points for the class attendance contribution to total performance for the school term.
There are class quizzes every week (19 in total for the term). Each quiz is graded over 10 maximum points. And a max aggregate score of 30 for the quiz contribution to total performance for the school term
Homework is assigned every week (19 in total for the term). Each homework is graded over 10 maximum points. And a max aggregate score of 15 points for the homework contribution to total performance for the school term


### SCRIPT UTILITY
1. The full performance records of any student by simply providing the student’s name or ID
2. Any student’s performance for any given subject by simply providing student name/ID and subject name
3. Fetch the list of students in any of the grade categories (A, B, C, D, E, F)
4. Fetch the list of students Statuses (Pass, Fail, Retake)
5. Obtain a response from the script for any student to determine if they passed, failed, or need to retake the subject


### SCRIPT CAPABILITIES:
1.	enables him to manually load each students scores by subject for quiz, homework, attendance, and exam using the python input() function. Use as data, the records in the Student Scores table below (Table1.0)
2.	Automatically computes the Average Score, GPA (0 to 5.0), Grade and Status (Pass, Fail, Retake) and stores in a container for each student as per the provided rating scales below
3.	Holds each student’s performance records in a container
4.	Holds each subject performance records in a container for all students
5.	Holds ALL student performance records for ALL subjects in a container. Note: this container should hold all student scores for subjects quiz, homework and exam scores, Average Score, GPA, Grade and Status. All in a Container of containers
Jerome would also like to have the functionality to query the containers above to fetch any specific performance records such as.
